## Steam has banned the domain!

It looks like steam unfortunately banned the domain SAGE tried to generate 
an account with.

1. Are you using `Default domain` mode?
    - you can buy a [custom domain](customdomain.md)
    - subscribe to our [Patreon](patreon.md)
    - inform us so we can remove the domain!

2. Are you using a `Custom domain`?
   - F - your domain got banned
   - You will have to buy a new one

3. Are you using our `Patreon domain` pool?
   - inform us so we can remove the domain!


## Steam is temporarily limiting account creations.

Steam is limiting account creations by IPs AND email domain.

- IP limit: `15/day`
- Domain limit: `200/day` (rough estimate)

You can try the following with your IP to resolve this issue:
1. restart your router to get a new IP (only works if you have a dynamic IP)
2. use a **good** vpn or **good** residential proxies
3. wait a day

Get a (new) [custom domain](customdomain.md) for domain limits.


## Steam refused account generation.

**Please don't ask us, we can't help you. This is an issue between you and Steam**

**Fristly**, you should **try again for up to 10 times**.
Steam seems to randomly give you this error if your IP's reputation is too low.

If you still get the error after 10 tries, it's likely that the reputation of your IP
sunk down to hell.

Possible solutions: (not guaranteed)
1. just wait **a few hours** and hope your IP's reputation recovers
2. restart your router to get a new IP (only works if you have a dynamic IP)
3. use a **good** vpn or **good** residential proxies

Didn't help? Tough, but we can't help you either.

## Your IP is banned by steam.

**Please don't ask us, we can't help you. This is an issue between you and Steam**

Your IP is banned by steam. We don't know why or for how long.

You are probably using a bad VPN or proxy. Try using a different one or don't use one.
