# Premium Domain

SAGE offers a special premium domain pool to our
[Premium Supporters](../premium.md).

The premium pool contains more domains than the free pool.

## Domain assignment

Currently every Premium Supporter is assigned to one domain which does not
change unless we add/remove domains from the pool.

This assignment is made so that one Premium Supporter cannot generate thousands
of accounts per day, limiting the domains for all other supporters.

We ran the numbers, this current system benefits the majority.
