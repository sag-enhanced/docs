# Custom Domain

TL;DR:

1. Add E-Mail forwarding for all emails to `sage@leodev.xyz`.
2. Go to https://sage.leodev.xyz/settings
3. Click on `Set custom domain`
4. Enter your domain and press return
5. Click on the big `Custom domain` button

## Banned domains

Steam can ban your domain anytime, but it's unlikely unless you are generating
hundreds of accounts each month.

Additionally, steam has completely banned a few top level domains (TLDs):

- `.xyz`
- All free domains (`.cf`, `.ga`, ...)

We recommend buying [cheap domains](https://www.namecheap.com/promos/99-cent-domain-names/) for one year at a time. (because they are often only cheap first year and then expensive after that)

## E-Mail forwarding using Cloudflare Email Routing

[Getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/get-started/enable-email-routing/)

Use `Catch-all address` with `sage@leodev.xyz` as destination.

Ask in [#sage in our Discord](https://leodev.xyz/discord) for the verification email.
