# Autopilot

Autopilot is a way to generate accounts automatically without human interaction.

This is **not** a mass gen and it does not support proxies.

## Set up

1. Set up a discord webhook in the settings (otherwise you'll lose your accounts)
2. Get the Noptcha extension for automatically solving CAPTCHAs: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noptcha-recaptcha-hcaptch/dknlfmjaanfblgfdfebhijalfmhmjjjo) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noptcha/)
3. Click on the extension icon and enable `Auto Open` and `Auto Solve`
4. Optional: Set the delay to 0ms (it doesn't matter, their servers are slow enough)
5. Go to settings, a `Enable Autopilot` button should appear below the discord webhook setting.
6. Done! After successfully generating an account or getting a recaptcha error, autopilot will automatically generate the next account or retry the CAPTCHA.
