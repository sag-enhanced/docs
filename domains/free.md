# Free Domain

SAGE offers a few free domains to everyone, in case you don't have a
[Custom Domain](customdomain.md) or [Premium Access](premium.md).

## Why does it not always work?

Steam limits account creations to _100 per day per domain_. For that reason, the
free domain is often limited because others are simply faster than you, and
already used up the entire quota.

To get around that, you'll either have to be lucky,
[buy a Custom Domain](customdomain.md) or [purchase Premium Access](premium.md).
(custom domains are cheaper!)
