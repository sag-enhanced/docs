## Steam is limiting account creations from your IP.

**Please don't ask us, we can't help you. This is an issue between you and Steam**

Steam is limiting account creations from every IP and it seems like you hit the limit.

The limit is: `15 per day per ip`.

If you hit this limit but did not generate any accounts, it's probably that someone
with the same ip address hit it (due to ip address sharing) or that steam does not
trust you.

You can try changing your IP to resolve this issue:
1. restart your router to get a new IP (only works if you have a dynamic IP)
2. use a **good** vpn or **good** residential proxies


## Steam refused account generation.

**Please don't ask us, we can't help you. This is an issue between you and Steam**

**Fristly**, you should **try again for up to 10 times**.
Steam seems to randomly give you this error if your IP's reputation is too low.

If you still get the error after 10 tries, it's likely that the reputation of your IP
sunk down to hell.

Possible solutions: (not guaranteed)
1. just wait **a few hours** and hope your IP's reputation recovers
2. restart your router to get a new IP (only works if you have a dynamic IP)
3. use a **good** vpn or **good** residential proxies

Didn't help? Tough, but we can't help you either.

## Your IP is banned by steam.

**Please don't ask us, we can't help you. This is an issue between you and Steam**

Your IP is banned by steam. We don't know why or for how long.

You are probably using a bad VPN or proxy. Try using a different one or don't use one.
