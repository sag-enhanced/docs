# Premium Access

SAGE runs on Donations and other contributions. SAGE does not display
advertisements, log or sell your data.

To pay for server costs and domains, we have to ask for support.

To thank, reward and incentive supporting, we introduced _Premium Access_.

Premium Access includes access to features early and a separate domain pool.

## Benefits

- [Premium Domain](domains/premium.md)
- [Account Customization](features/customization.md)
- [Mass Generator](features/mass-generator.md)
- exlusive role and channels on [our Discord](https://sage.party/discord)

## Supporting

There are several ways to gain Premium Access:

- [subscribe on Patreon](#patreon)
- [pre-pay with Crypto](#crypto)
- [boost our Discord](#discord-boost)

### Patreon

We have a Patreon! You can subscribe with PayPal or Credit Card for as little as
1€/month.

[!ref Patreon](https://patreon.com/sag_enhanced)

To get your role on [our Discord](https://sage.party/discord), you need to
[link your Discord account to Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps).

!!! Basic (1€/mo) vs Cool Tier (5€/mo) There is no functional differences
between the two tiers except the Discord role you get.

- Basic Patrons receive the `Basic Patron` role
- Cool Patrons receive the `Cool Patron` role - darker purple color - above
  `Basic Patron` in the member list - cooler !!!

### Crypto

We currently accept the following two currencies:

- Ethereum
- USDC (on Ethereum)

**1€ = 1 month** of access (the current USD/ETH ~ EUR exchange rate applies).
Due to the inherently high fees, a minimum of 3€ is enforced.

Please open a ticket in [our Discord](https://sage.party/discord) and we'll send
you our wallet address.

Please send your transaction id after you've sent the funds.

After we've manually confirmed the transaction, you'll receive the
`Crypto Supporter` for the duration of your subscription. You should see a
`#discord-login` channel where you can log into the website.

### Discord Boost

You can boost our Discord server at any time to gain Premium Access. After
boosting, a `#discord-login` channel will become visible where you can log into
the website.

Your access will expire if you unboost the server.
